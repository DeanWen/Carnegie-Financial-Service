### Database Interfaces
  To be continued;  
  Currenlty I implemented employee register action for testing.
  
### How to configure to your local repository? 
Two ways very easy  
<pre>
1.Directly import from your Eclipse 
    --File
      --Imoort
        --Git
          --Project from Github
2.Clone the repository from your Github Client
      --Import Exisiting project
</pre>

### How do you know your configure succeed?
After you run on your local Tomcat Server,  You will see DAO Test page, once you click "Done" button, "Register Successfully" Message come out. 

Congratulations! You totally did that correct and start Coding your action now.

Let's Ace the Task!
